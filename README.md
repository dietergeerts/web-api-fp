> Web APIs for usage in a Functional Programming style

All [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) are build OOP
style, which isn't always ideal to use, and if your code is using a Functional
Programming style, you may want to use the Web APIs the same way. Therefore this
package is created, in order to do exactly that.

Looking through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), I could not find many packages
that are doing this, and the ones I found did not include enough, or where not
that great FP-wise. I hope this package can become a great FP Web API package.

Not only is the code designed FP wise, it's also designed to give great
auto-complete by your favorite editors like WebStorm through JSDocs.
TODO: Add example that shows this (with GIF?)
